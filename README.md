# A Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) model for Tonsil microbiome
# A Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) model, a probabilistic based method for community clustering of microbial population profiling. The DMM model was used to identify subgroups or metacommunities with a similar composition. The advantages of using DMM model is that DMM model can determine the optimal number of community types that fit the data best and identifies the contribution of each taxonomic group to each component.
